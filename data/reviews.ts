    text: "I was walking around Crate and Barrel and on a whim decided to buy a sofa and chair. I literally dropped the pin and they were already on the way before I left the store. I could not believe how quick it all happened. Jackson and Severiano were careful and quickly to get everything inside and unwrapped. Excellent experience, friendly movers that kept in communication the whole time. Would do it again anytime, highly recommend!",

    text: "Lugg is THE best! Solomon and Yuri were great! For my most recent purchase I coordinated a pickup elsewhere and drop off at my place. They were fast, efficient, friendly, and extremely helpful (I needed to move a piece of furniture to make some room for the item they picked up). They were in and out in 10 minutes! Thanks a ton!",

    text: "Iâ€™ve used Lugg twice in one week to finish moving and it's been a breeze!! Both times -- first with Jamel and Elias, and today with Severiano and Nick -- they were prompt, super nice, and super efficient. Hope I don't have to move again anytime soon (ha) but it'll definitely be less daunting now that I know I can call Lugg and they'll send over awesome folks to help me out! :). ",

    text: "Just moved to SF and bought this bed on Craigslist. Not having a car or knowing anyone with a car in the city, I requested movers through the app. They arrived at pick up location even before me! I had to move a bed and they did the job quick. Both movers were very courteous and careful about the item and about my house. Would definitely recommend to anyone and use again!",
